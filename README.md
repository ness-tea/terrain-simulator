# Terrain-Simulator v.0
An interactive 3D terrain simulator programmed with the OpenGL API, using the Circles Algorithm for generating heightmap values.  
An assignment for 3GC3 Computer Graphics.

## What has been implemented:
#### 1. SELECTABLE GRID SIZES : 
   - 50 x 50
   - 100 x 100
   - 150 x 150
   - 200 x 200
   - 250 x 250
   - 300 x 300
#### 2. SHADING MODELS: 
   - Flat
   - Gouraud
#### 3. WIREFRAME OPTIONS: 
   - Solid	      
   - Wireframe
   - Solid + Wireframe (NOT PROPERLY)
#### 4. QUAD and TRI STRIP MODE
#### 5. Orbiting the terrain 
   - need to figure out how to work with each x-z plane quad
   - rotating around the x axis to limit
#### 6. Lighting (Looks better with bigger terrain and Gouraud shading)
   - normal calculations
   - Light 1 and Light 2
   - Interactive Lighting (only along x-axis)
#### 7. Interactive Camera
   - Rotates around y-axis
   - Rotates around z-axis

## BONUS FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
1. 2D Terrain Overview
2. Terrain Modification
   - Use 2D overview to alter terrain heightmap
3. Improved Colour Scheme
4. Create a Terrain 
   - Create a terrain from scratch
   - Selectable terrain sizes 
   - Left click + hold on area to create bump
   - Right click + hold on area to create dent
